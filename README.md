# SCIM 2 Jersey example

This is a simple example that demonstrates the basics of writing a SCIM 2 service 
using the [SCIM 2 SDK](https://github.com/pingidentity/scim2) and 
[Jersey](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/) (JAX-RS).

For more example code, it may be helpful to look at the unit tests for the
**scim2-sdk-server** component. For general usage information on the SCIM 2 SDK, 
visit the [SCIM 2 SDK wiki](https://github.com/pingidentity/scim2/wiki).
